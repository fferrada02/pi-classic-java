# A Java Version of Pascal Sebah : 1999 program to compute PI
# in Multiprecition (from 100 to 100000 digits)

## Introduction

This is a Java version of an old C source code program to compute pi in multiprecition. very simple.
take over 20 sec to compute 100.000 digits of pi in my intel core i3 3.0 GHZ

## details

this program use machin-like formula for compute pi (Gauss version)

```
Pi/4 = 12*arctan(1/18)+8*arctan(1/57)-5*arctan(1/239) (Gauss)
```
